It uses a hash table to store the elements, which allows for average time complexity of O(1) for these operations. Each element is hashed to compute an index in an underlying array, where the element is stored. In the event of hash collisions, the structure typically employs techniques such as chaining or open addressing.\n**Implementation Code**\n```python\nclass HashSet:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.size = 1000  # Initial size of the hash table\n        self.table = [[] for _ in range(self.size)]  # Initialize hash table with empty lists\n    \n    def _hash(self, key):\n        return key % self.size  # Simple hash function\n\n    def add(self, key):\n        index = self._hash(key)\n        if key not in self.table[index]:  # Check for duplicates\n            self.table[index].append(key)  # Append key to the list at the hashed index\n\n    def remove(self, key):\n        index = self._hash(key)\n        if key in self.table[index]:\n            self.table[index].remove(key)  # Remove the key if it exists\n\n    def contains(self, key):\n        index = self._hash(key)\n        return key in self.table[index]  # Return True if the key is found, otherwise False\n```\n\nHere is your task:\n**Concept**\nPairing Heap\n**Definition**\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}
