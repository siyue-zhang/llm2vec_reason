Implement a function `maximum_independent_set(n: int, conflicts: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[int]` that takes the number of performances `n` and a list of conflicting pairs, and returns a valid independent set of performances or an empty list if no such set exists.\n\n**Function Signature**:\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef maximum_independent_set(n: int, conflicts: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[int]:\n```\n\n**Constraints**:\n- 1 <= n <= 2000\n- 0 <= len(conflicts) <= 5000\n- Each conflicting pair consists of unique performance identifiers in the range [0, n-1].\n\n**Example**:\n```python\nn = 5\nconflicts = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]\nprint(maximum_independent_set(n, conflicts)) \n# Output: [0, 2, 4] or any combination that satisfies the independent condition\n\nn = 3\nconflicts = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2)]\nprint(maximum_independent_set(n, conflicts)) \n# Output: []  (since every performance conflicts with another)\n```\n\n```python\ndef maximum_independent_set(n: int, conflicts: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[int]:\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    \n    adjacency_list = defaultdict(set)\n    for u, v in conflicts:\n        adjacency_list[u].add(v)\n        adjacency_list[v].add(u)\n\n    independent_set = []\n    selected = [False] * n\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if not selected[i]:\n            independent_set.append(i)\n            for neighbor in adjacency_list[i]:\n                selected[neighbor] = True\n                \n    return independent_set\n``` \n\nIn this implementation, you create an adjacency list to track performance conflicts. The algorithm iteratively selects performances for the independent set while marking all conflicting performances as selected, ensuring that no two chosen performances are adjacent. If a valid independent set cannot be formed, the function returns an empty list.\n\nIs this document about the Kahn's Algorithm? If yes, response YES.

Your goal is to implement a function that generates a compact representation of categories without any of the codes being prefixes of one another.\n\nYou need to represent this relationship and develop an algorithm that assigns integer codes to the categories based on their publication years, with the rule that no code is a prefix of any other. \n\nYour function signature should look like this:\n\n```python\ndef create_book_category_codes(categories: Dict[str, int]) -> Dict[str, int]:\n```\n\nHere, `categories` is a dictionary where keys are category names and values are the corresponding publication years.

These tasks have specific constraints on the maximum time they can take. Your goal is to schedule the tasks in such a way that the total time taken does not exceed a given limit, while respecting the maximum time constraints of each task. Each task must be completed in a single run and cannot be split across different time slots.\n\nConstraints:\n- The number of tasks \\( n \\) will be between 1 and \\( 10^6 \\).\n- You are given a list where each task is represented as a pair (task_id, max_time), indicating the unique identifier and the maximum time it can take.\n- You also have an integer \\( max_total_time \\), which is the total time limit for all tasks combined.\n\nYour task is to write a function `schedule_tasks(n: int, tasks: List[Tuple[int, int]], max_total_time: int) -> List[int]` that returns the identifiers of the tasks that can be scheduled without exceeding the total time limit while observing the individual maximum times.\n\nExample:\n```\nInput: \nn = 5\ntasks = [(0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (4, 2)]\nmax_total_time = 6\n\nOutput: \n[0, 1, 3] or a different valid combination where the total time does not exceed 6.\n```\n\nFunction Signature:\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef schedule_tasks(n: int, tasks: List[Tuple[int, int]], max_total_time: int) -> List[int]:\n    # Your code here\n```\n\nSolution Code:\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef schedule_tasks(n: int, tasks: List[Tuple[int, int]], max_total_time: int) -> List[int]:\n    # Sort tasks based on their time requirements\n    tasks.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n    \n    selected_tasks = []\n    total_time = 0\n    \n    for task_id, max_time in tasks:\n        if total_time + max_time <= max_total_time:\n            selected_tasks.append(task_id)\n            total_time += max_time\n    \n    return selected_tasks\n```\n\nIn this example, the function finds a combination of tasks that fulfills the time constraint. The tasks selected accumulate a total time that does not exceed the given `max_total_time`, allowing for flexibility based on individual task requirements.\n\n---\n\nIs this document about the Topological Sorting?

Given a list of bus stops and the direct travel times between them, you need to implement a method to compute the longest possible travel times from a specified start bus stop while considering various connecting routes. \n\nYou are given a matrix `time`, where `time[i][j]` represents the travel time from bus stop `i` to bus stop `j`. A value of zero means that there is a direct route with the given travel time, while a negative value means that the route does not exist between the bus stops.\n\nImplement a function that computes the longest travel times from a given start bus stop to each bus stop and returns the resulting array.\n\n**Function Signature**:\n```python\ndef computeLongestTravelTimes(time: List[List[int]], start: int) -> List[int]:\n```\n\n**Constraints**:\n- The number of bus stops, `n`, can be at most 100.\n- The travel times are non-negative integers and the matrix is symmetric (i.e., `time[i][j]` equals `time[j][i]`).\n- You may assume `time[i][i]` = 0 for all `i`.\n\n**Example**:\nInput:\n```python\ntime = [\n    [0, 5, INT_MIN, 10],\n    [5, 0, 15, INT_MIN],\n    [INT_MIN, 15, 0, 20],\n    [10, INT_MIN, 20, 0]\n]\nstart = 0\n```\n\nOutput:\n```python\n[0, 5, 20, 10]\n```\n\n**Note**: The output list should indicate the longest reachable travel time from the start bus stop to each other bus stop.

You may use a min-heap data structure to achieve this. \n\n**Example**:  \nInput: `donations = [50, 20, 30, 100, 50, 70], k = 3`  \nOutput: `[100, 70, 50]`\n\nHere is the Python implementation for the problem:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef topKDonations(donations, k):\n    if k <= 0 or not donations:\n        return []\n    \n    # Use a min-heap to keep track of the top k donations\n    min_heap = []\n    \n    for donation in donations:\n        # Push the donation onto the heap\n        heapq.heappush(min_heap, donation)\n        # If the heap exceeds size k, pop the smallest element\n        if len(min_heap) > k:\n            heapq.heappop(min_heap)\n\n    # The heap now contains the k largest donations, we will sort them in descending order\n    return sorted(min_heap, reverse=True)\n\n# Example usage\ndonations = [500, 1500, 200, 700, 1200, 300]\nk = 3\nresult = topKDonations(donations, k)\nprint(\"Top K Donations:\", result)\n```\n\nIn this code, we utilize a min-heap to efficiently track the largest donations, ensuring that we only keep the `k` largest contributions at any time. After processing all donations, we return the sorted largest donations in descending order.\n\nIs this document about the Merge Sort? If yes, response YES.

The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the leftmost unsorted element, moving the boundary between sorted and unsorted parts one element to the right.\n\nWrite a Python function `selection_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]` that takes an integer array as input and modifies the array in-place to sort the elements in ascending order.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef selection_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    n = len(arr)\n    \n    # Implementing the selection sort algorithm\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Assume the minimum is the first element of the unsorted part\n        min_index = i\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            # Find the index of the minimum element in the unsorted part\n            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = j\n        # Swap the found minimum element with the first element of the unsorted part\n        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]\n    \n    return arr\n\n# Example usage:\narray_to_sort = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]\nsorted_array = selection_sort(array_to_sort)\nprint(sorted_array)  # Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]\n```\n\nIs this document about the Bubble Sort?

Your function should take an array of integers representing the scores of the items and return a new array sorted from lowest to highest score.

Phrases should be tokenized into words, normalized to lowercase, and any punctuation should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n- For the phrases `\"I like to dance\"` and `\"I like dancing\"`, the Jaccard similarity would be calculated as follows:\n  - Tokenized sets: `{\u2018i\u2019, \u2018like\u2019, \u2018to\u2019, \u2018dance\u2019}` and `{\u2018i\u2019, \u2018like\u2019, \u2018dancing\u2019}`\n  - Intersection: `{\u2018i\u2019, \u2018like\u2019}` (2 elements)\n  - Union: `{\u2018i\u2019, \u2018like\u2019, \u2018to\u2019, \u2018dance\u2019, \u2018dancing\u2019}` (5 elements)\n  - Jaccard similarity = Intersection size / Union size = 2 / 5 = 0.4\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef jaccard_similarity(phrase1: str, phrase2: str) -> float:\n    import string\n\n    # Normalize and tokenize the phrases\n    def tokenize(phrase):\n        # Remove punctuation and convert to lowercase\n        phrase = phrase.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)).lower()\n        return set(phrase.split())\n\n    set1 = tokenize(phrase1)\n    set2 = tokenize(phrase2)\n\n    # Calculate intersection and union\n    intersection = set1.intersection(set2)\n    union = set1.union(set2)\n\n    if not union:\n        return 1.0  # If both sets are empty, return 1.0 for similarity\n\n    # Jaccard similarity\n    return len(intersection) / len(union)\n\n# Example usage\nphrase1 = \"I like to dance\"\nphrase2 = \"I like dancing\"\nsimilarity_score = jaccard_similarity(phrase1, phrase2)\nprint(f\"The Jaccard similarity score is: {similarity_score}\")\n```\n\nThis function allows you to effectively compare the similarity between different phrases by analyzing the commonality of the words within them, offering a useful perspective for linguists and researchers analyzing dialect variations.\n\nIs this document about the Edit Distance?

The function should return the total number of friends attending in the \\( K \\)th year.\n\n**Input**: \n- \\( P1 \\): Number of friends attending in year 1 (1 \u2264 \\( P1 \\) \u2264 10^9)\n- \\( D \\): The percentage decrease factor (0 < \\( D < 1 \\))\n- \\( K \\): The target year (1 \u2264 \\( K \\) \u2264 10^9)\n\nThe attendance pattern follows:\n- Year 1: \\( P1 \\)\n- Year 2: \\( P1 * (1 - D) \\)\n- Year 3: \\( P1 * (1 - D)^2 \\)\n- Year 4: \\( P1 * (1 - D)^3 \\)\n- And so on...\n\n**Output**: \nThe number of friends attending in the \\( K \\)th year rounded down to the nearest integer.\n\n**Example**:\n- Input: `findAttendees(100, 0.2, 5)`\n- Output: `65` (Because the sequence is 100, 80, 64, 51, 41...)\n\n```python\ndef findAttendees(P1, D, K):\n    if K == 1:\n        return P1\n    else:\n        attendees = P1 * ((1 - D) ** (K - 1))\n        return int(attendees)  # Round down to nearest integer\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    P1 = 100  # Initial attendance\n    D = 0.2   # 20% decrease\n    K = 5     # Target year\n\n    print(\"Number of friends attending in year\", K, \":\", findAttendees(P1, D, K))\n```\n\nThis problem provides a different algorithm based on exponential decay rather than a Fibonacci-like growth, creating a contextually relevant yet challenging distinction from the original user query.\n\nIs this document about the Matrix Exponentiation?

The function should return an array of integers where each element corresponds to the total number of visible flowers in the specified range for each query.\n\n**Constraints**:\n1. 1 \u2264 len(houses) \u2264 10^5 (number of houses)\n2. 1 \u2264 Q \u2264 10^6 (number of queries)\n3. Each value in houses is a non-negative integer.\n\n**Python function**:\n\n```python\ndef visibleFlowers(houses, queries):\n    n = len(houses)\n    results = []\n\n    # Precompute the visible flowers for each house\n    visible = [0] * n\n    stack = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        while stack and houses[stack[-1]] < houses[i]:\n            stack.pop()\n        visible[i] = houses[i] if not stack else 0\n        stack.append(i)\n\n    # We accumulate the visible flowers up to each index\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        visible[i] += visible[i - 1]\n\n    # Process each query\n    for left, right in queries:\n        if left == 0:\n            results.append(visible[right])\n        else:\n            results.append(visible[right] - visible[left - 1])\n\n    return results\n```\n\nThis implementation calculates the total visible flowers in a specified range of houses. It utilizes a stack to maintain the visibility constraint of taller houses blocking others and precomputes the total visible counts for optimized query processing. This approach helps to answer each query in constant time after an initial linear time preprocessing.\n\nIs this document about the Mo's Algorithm? If yes, response YES.

The bus stops (nodes) and connections can be represented as a directed graph.\n\nGiven the following inputs:\n- An integer `n` representing the number of bus stops (nodes).\n- A list of edges where each edge is represented as a list of three integers `[u, v, capacity]`, indicating a directed route from bus stop `u` to bus stop `v` with a maximum bus capacity of `capacity`.\n\nYour task is to implement a function that returns the maximum number of buses that can be scheduled to run from the terminal bus station (bus stop `0`) to the main bus hub (bus stop `n-1`).\n\n**Function Signature**: \n```python\ndef maxBuses(n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n```\n\n**Example**:\n```python\n# Input\nn = 6\nedges = [\n    [0, 1, 12],\n    [0, 2, 8],\n    [1, 2, 10],\n    [1, 3, 6],\n    [2, 4, 7],\n    [3, 5, 9],\n    [4, 3, 4],\n    [4, 5, 12]\n]\n\n# Output\nmaxBuses(n, edges) # 18\n```\n\nTo solve this problem, you can represent the graph using an adjacency list and implement a breadth-first search (BFS) to identify the maximum number of buses that can be routed from the terminal to the main hub while adhering to route capacities.\n\nHere is a potential implementation using BFS:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\nclass MaxBusFlow:\n    def __init__(self, n):\n        self.n = n\n        self.adj = defaultdict(list)\n        self.capacity = {}\n\n    def add_route(self, u, v, cap):\n        self.adj[u].append(v)\n        self.adj[v].append(u)\n        self.capacity[(u, v)] = cap\n        self.capacity[(v, u)] = 0  # reverse route\n\n    def bfs(self, source, sink, parent):\n        visited = [False] * self.n\n        queue = deque([source])\n        visited[source] = True\n\n        while queue:\n            u = queue.popleft()\n            for v in self.adj[u]:\n                if not visited[v] and self.capacity[(u, v)] > 0:\n                    queue.append(v)\n                    visited[v] = True\n                    parent[v] = u\n                    if v == sink:\n                        return True\n        return False\n\n    def compute_max_flow(self, source, sink):\n        total_flow = 0\n        parent = [-1] * self.n\n\n        while self.bfs(source, sink, parent):\n            path_flow = float('Inf')\n            s = sink\n            while s != source:\n                path_flow = min(path_flow, self.capacity[(parent[s], s)])\n                s = parent[s]\n\n            v = sink\n            while v != source:\n                u = parent[v]\n                self.capacity[(u, v)] -= path_flow\n                self.capacity[(v, u)] += path_flow\n                v = parent[v]\n\n            total_flow += path_flow\n\n        return total_flow\n\ndef maxBuses(n, edges):\n    source = 0\n    sink = n - 1\n    busFlow = MaxBusFlow(n)\n\n    for u, v, cap in edges:\n        busFlow.add_route(u, v, cap)\n\n    return busFlow.compute_max_flow(source, sink)\n\n# Example Usage\nn = 6\nedges = [\n    [0, 1, 12],\n    [0, 2, 8],\n    [1, 2, 10],\n    [1, 3, 6],\n    [2, 4, 7],\n    [3, 5, 9],\n    [4, 3, 4],\n    [4, 5, 12]\n]\nprint(maxBuses(n, edges))  # Output: 18\n``` \n\nThis solution focuses on efficiently determining the maximum number of buses that can be used, which is a different problem from the user query.\n\nIs this document about the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm?

The seating arrangement is set up on a circular arrangement where each guest has a unique seat number from 1 to N. Each guest has specific friends they would like to sit next to, and you need to account for this while creating the seating plan. \n\nThe problem is to determine if you can arrange the guests so that every guest can sit next to at least one of their invited friends. Given the preferences provided in the form of tuples, your task is to write a function `can_seat_guests(n: int, preferences: List[Tuple[int, List[int]]]) -> List[int]` that takes the number of guests `n` and a list of tuples where each tuple has a guest number and a list of their preferred friends.

Transparent pixels (-1) must not be altered by the filter and should retain their value.\n\nGiven an input 2D array representing the image, write a method that applies the filter and modifies the image in-place according to the constraints described.\n\nImplement the method `applyImageFilter(image)` that takes a 2D integer array as input and modifies it to apply the filtering process.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the filter application:\n\n```python\ndef applyImageFilter(image):\n    rows = len(image)\n    cols = len(image[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    new_image = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    \n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if image[r][c] == -1:  # Checker for transparency\n                new_image[r][c] = -1\n                continue\n            \n            # Initialize a list for neighborhood values\n            neighbors = []\n            for dr in range(-1, 2):\n                for dc in range(-1, 2):\n                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                    if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and image[nr][nc] != -1:\n                        neighbors.append(image[nr][nc])\n            \n            # Apply a simple average filter to the pixel\n            if neighbors:\n                new_image[r][c] = min(max(sum(neighbors) // len(neighbors), 0), 255)\n            else:\n                new_image[r][c] = image[r][c]  # Shouldn't happen\n\n    # Copy new_image back into image\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            image[r][c] = new_image[r][c]\n\n# Example of usage\nimage = [\n    [100, 150, -1],\n    [70, 80, 60],\n    [-1, 90, 120]\n]\napplyImageFilter(image)\n```\n\nBy using the above implementation, you can successfully apply a filter to your grid-based image while meeting the necessary constraints.\n\nIs this document about the Sudoku Solver?

The constraints are as follows:\n- The length of the scores array is between `1` and `10^6`, and each score is a non-negative integer. \n\nBelow is the implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef merge_sort_scores(scores: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    if len(scores) <= 1:\n        return scores\n\n    mid = len(scores) // 2\n    left_half = merge_sort_scores(scores[:mid])\n    right_half = merge_sort_scores(scores[mid:])\n    \n    return merge(left_half, right_half)\n\ndef merge(left: List[int], right: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    sorted_scores = []\n    i = j = 0\n    \n    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):\n        if left[i] <= right[j]:\n            sorted_scores.append(left[i])\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            sorted_scores.append(right[j])\n            j += 1\n            \n    # Add remaining elements\n    while i < len(left):\n        sorted_scores.append(left[i])\n        i += 1\n    \n    while j < len(right):\n        sorted_scores.append(right[j])\n        j += 1\n        \n    return sorted_scores\n\n# Example usage\nscores = [120, 85, 150, 90, 200, 170]\nsorted_scores = merge_sort_scores(scores)\nprint(sorted_scores)  # Output: [85, 90, 120, 150, 170, 200]\n```\n\nIs this document about the Bucket Sort?

The goal is to minimize the difference (error) between the actual values `y` and the values predicted by the polynomial function using the Least Squares method.\n\nWrite a function `fit_polynomial(points: List[Tuple[float, float]], degree: int) -> List[float]` that computes and returns the coefficients of the polynomial that best fits the given points.\n\nThe input parameters are:\n- `points`: A list of tuples representing the (x, y) coordinates.\n- `degree`: An integer representing the degree of the polynomial to fit.\n\nYou may use libraries like NumPy to facilitate the calculations.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef fit_polynomial(points: List[Tuple[float, float]], degree: int) -> List[float]:\n    # Extract x and y values from points\n    x = np.array([point[0] for point in points])\n    y = np.array([point[1] for point in points])\n    \n    # Fit a polynomial of the specified degree\n    coefficients = np.polyfit(x, y, degree)\n    \n    return coefficients.tolist()  # Return coefficients as a list\n\n# Example of usage\ndata_points = [(1, 2), (2, 8), (3, 18)]\ndegree = 2\ncoefficients = fit_polynomial(data_points, degree)\nprint(f\"Fitted polynomial coefficients: {coefficients}\")\n```\n\nThis code implements polynomial fitting, which differs from the linear regression approach of minimizing residuals using gradient descent. Instead, a direct method using least squares optimization is applied to derive the polynomial coefficients.\n\nIs this document about the Gradient Descent? If yes, response YES.

You'd like to know how many unique ways the sentences can be arranged to form a coherent message. A message is coherent if no two consecutive sentences share the same starting letter.\n\nYour task is to write a function `count_coherent_arrangements(sentences: List[str]) -> int` that computes the number of unique arrangements of the sentences such that no two consecutive sentences start with the same letter.\n\nFor example:\n```python\nsentences = [\"Thank you for coming!\", \"We appreciate your presence.\", \"Your support means a lot.\"]\ncount_coherent_arrangements(sentences) -> 6\n```\nIn this example, there are six ways to arrange three unique sentences without repeating the starting letter for consecutive sentences.\n\n**Function Requirements:**\n1. The function should accept a list of sentences and return an integer representing the number of unique arrangements meeting the described criteria.\n2.

The algorithm works on the principle of iteratively narrowing down the interval that contains the root.\n\nWrite a function `min_baking_temperature(lower_bound, upper_bound, height)` that takes a lower bound and an upper bound for the temperature as well as the target height. The function should use the bisection method to find the temperature \\( T \\) where the height \\( H(T) \\) is equal to the specified height. The process should continue until the width of the interval is less than a predefined tolerance.\n\nThe function should return the temperature at which the cake reaches the specified height, rounded to 2 decimal places.\n\nHere is the Python solution code:\n\n```python\ndef height_function(T):\n    return T**3 - 6*T**2 + 9*T - 1\n\ndef min_baking_temperature(lower_bound, upper_bound, height, tolerance=1e-5):\n    if height_function(lower_bound) > height or height_function(upper_bound) < height:\n        raise ValueError(\"The height value is not within the function bounds.\")\n    \n    while (upper_bound - lower_bound) > tolerance:\n        mid_point = (lower_bound + upper_bound) / 2\n        if height_function(mid_point) < height:\n            lower_bound = mid_point\n        else:\n            upper_bound = mid_point\n    \n    return round((lower_bound + upper_bound) / 2, 2)\n\n# Example usage\nlower_bound = 0\nupper_bound = 10\ntarget_height = 5\n\noptimal_temp = min_baking_temperature(lower_bound, upper_bound, target_height)\nprint(f\"Minimum temperature for desired height: {optimal_temp}\")  # Expected output around optimal temperature\n```\n\nIn this problem, you will not maximize the height of the cake, but ensure that it reaches a specific height of 5 by finding the corresponding temperature using the bisection method.

If no such subsequence exists, return 0.\n\nFor example, if the activity identifiers are `[\"dance\", \"dancing\", \"dance-off\", \"dancer\", \"runner\", \"dance\"]` and the theme is `\"dance\"`, the output should be `5`, because the longest subsequence starting and ending with \"dance\" includes all the activities from the first \"dance\" to the last \"dance\".\n\n**Constraints**:\n- The activity identifiers consist of lowercase letters (a-z).\n- The maximum number of activity identifiers will not exceed 10^4.\n- The total length of all activity identifiers will not exceed 10^6.\n\n### Python Code Solution\n\n```python\ndef findLongestThemeSubsequence(activities, theme):\n    longest_length = 0\n    n = len(activities)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if activities[i].startswith(theme):\n            for j in range(n - 1, i - 1, -1):\n                if activities[j].startswith(theme):\n                    # Calculate the length of the subsequence from i to j\n                    current_length = j - i + 1\n                    longest_length = max(longest_length, current_length)\n                    break  # No need to find further if we found a valid ending\n    \n    return longest_length\n\n# Example usage:\nactivities = [\"dance\", \"dancing\", \"dance-off\", \"dancer\", \"runner\", \"dance\"]\ntheme = \"dance\"\nprint(findLongestThemeSubsequence(activities, theme))  # Output: 5\n\nactivities2 = [\"run\", \"jump\", \"play\", \"exercise\"]\ntheme2 = \"dance\"\nprint(findLongestThemeSubsequence(activities2, theme2))  # Output: 0\n```\n\nIs this document about the Z Algorithm?
