Given a list of bus stops and the direct travel times \n    between them, you need to implement a method to compute the longest possible travel times from \n    a specified start bus stop while considering various connecting routes.\n\n    You are given a matrix `time`, where `time[i][j]` represents the travel time from bus stop `i` \n    to bus stop `j`. A value of zero means that there is a direct route with the given travel time, \n    while a negative value means that the route does not exist between the bus stops.\n\n    Constraints:\n    - The number of bus stops, `n`, can be at most 100.\n    - The travel times are non-negative integers and the matrix is symmetric (i.e., `time[i][j]` \n      equals `time[j][i]`).\n    - You may assume `time[i][i]` = 0 for all `i`.\n\n    Example:\n    Input:\n    time = [[0, 5, INT_MIN, 10],\n            [5, 0, 15, INT_MIN],\n            [INT_MIN, 15, 0, 20],\n            [10, INT_MIN, 20, 0]]\n    start = 0\n\n    Output: [0, 5, 20, 10]\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(time)\n    # Initialize travel time list with negative infinity\n    longest_times = [-1] * n\n    longest_times[start] = 0  # Start point is 0 distance from itself\n\n    # Use a modified BFS or DFS to find longest paths\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if time[start][j] != float('-inf') and (longest_times[j] < longest_times[start] + time[start][j]):\n                longest_times[j] = longest_times[start] + time[start][j]\n\n    return longest_times\n\n# Example usage:\ntime = [\n    [0, 5, float('-inf'), 10],\n    [5, 0, 15, float('-inf')],\n    [float('-inf'), 15, 0, 20],\n    [10, float('-inf'), 20, 0]\n]\nstart = 0\nresult = computeLongestTravelTimes(time, start)\nprint(result)  # Should output [0, 5, 20, 10]\n```", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 813, "completion_tokens": 628, "total_tokens": 1441, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5"}}, "error": null}

The Quick Sort algorithm works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. You should implement the sorting such that it recursively sorts the sub-arrays.\n\nAdditionally, your solution should handle cases where the array has zero or one element, as these are already sorted by definition. Write a function in Python that takes an array and sorts it in-place.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef quick_sort(arr, low, high):\n    if low < high:\n        # Partitioning index\n        pi = partition(arr, low, high)\n\n        # Recursively sort elements before partition and after partition\n        quick_sort(arr, low, pi - 1)\n        quick_sort(arr, pi + 1, high)\n\ndef partition(arr, low, high):\n    pivot = arr[high]  # pivot\n    i = low - 1  # Index of smaller element\n    for j in range(low, high):\n        # If current element is smaller than or equal to pivot\n        if arr[j] <= pivot:\n            i += 1  # increment index of smaller element\n            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]  # swap\n    arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]  # swap the pivot\n    return i + 1\n\ndef sort_array(arr):\n    quick_sort(arr, 0, len(arr) - 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    donations = [500, 1500, 200, 700, 1200, 300]\n    sort_array(donations)\n\n    print(\"Sorted Donations:\", donations)\n```", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 475, "completion_tokens": 416, "total_tokens": 891, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5"}}, "error": null}

Maria has an existing list of recipe names and needs a mechanism to efficiently sort the new recipes she has received, which may have minor variations in naming. However, she is also interested in grouping similar recipe names together based on shared substrings.\n\n    Your goal is to write a function that groups new recipes into clusters based on their longest common substring with the existing recipes. For each new recipe, you need to return a list of the existing recipe names it is most similar to, based on the longest common substring found.\n\n    Implement a function named `group_similar_recipes(existing_recipes, new_recipes)` that takes two parameters:\n\n    - `existing_recipes` (list of strings): The list of original recipe names available.\n    - `new_recipes` (list of strings): The list of new recipe names that need to be clustered.\n\n    The function should return a dictionary where each key is a new recipe name, and the value is a list of existing recipe names that share the longest common substring with it.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    def longest_common_substring(str1, str2):\n        m, n = len(str1), len(str2)\n        length = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n        longest = 0\n        result = \"\"\n        \n        for i in range(1, m + 1):\n            for j in range(1, n + 1):\n                if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n                    length[i][j] = length[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n                    if length[i][j] > longest:\n                        longest = length[i][j]\n                        result = str1[i - longest:i]\n                else:\n                    length[i][j] = 0\n                    \n        return result\n\n    groups = {}\n    \n    for new_recipe in new_recipes:\n        common_groups = []\n        max_length = 0\n        \n        for existing_recipe in existing_recipes:\n            common_substring = longest_common_substring(new_recipe, existing_recipe)\n            \n            if len(common_substring) > max_length:\n                max_length = len(common_substring)\n                common_groups = [existing_recipe]\n            elif len(common_substring) == max_length:\n                common_groups.append(existing_recipe)\n        \n        groups[new_recipe] = common_groups\n    \n    return groups\n\n# Test cases\nexisting_recipes = [\"spaghetti\", \"pancakes\", \"omelette\"]\nnew_recipes = [\"spagheti\", \"paincakes\", \"omelet\"]\nprint(group_similar_recipes(existing_recipes, new_recipes))\n# Output:\n# {\n#   \"spagheti\": [\"spaghetti\"],\n#   \"paincakes\": [\"pancakes\"],\n#   \"omelet\": [\"omelette\"]\n# }\n```", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 873, "completion_tokens": 649, "total_tokens": 1522, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5"}}, "error": null}
