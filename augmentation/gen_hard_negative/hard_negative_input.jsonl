Hence, the answer is `True`.\n- If `resources = [3, 3, 3]`, it is not possible since no kingdom can attack another (as they all have equal resources), so the answer is `False`.\n\nWrite a function `can_destroy_all_kingdoms(resources: List[int]) -> bool` that takes a list of integers and returns a boolean value.\n\n    **positive document**\n    You are given a game consisting of `n` piles of stones.

You should return \"First\" if the first player is guaranteed to win and \"Second\" if the second player is guaranteed to win. \n\nYou are to implement the following function:\n\n```cpp\nstd::string determine_winner(std::vector<int> a);\n```\n\n**Input**:\n- A single integer `n` (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) denotes the number of piles.\n- A vector of integers `a` (1 \u2264 a[i] \u2264 10^9), where `a[i]` is the number of stones in pile `i`.\n\n**Output**:\n- Return \"First\" if the first player wins the game with optimal play, otherwise return \"Second\".\n\n**Example**:\n```cpp\nInput: \nn = 3\na = [3, 4, 5]\n\nOutput: \n\"First\"\n```\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n\nstd::string determine_winner(std::vector<int> a) {\n    int xor_sum = 0;\n    \n    // Calculate the XOR of all piles\n    for (int stones : a) {\n        xor_sum ^= stones;\n    }\n    \n    // Determine the winner based on the XOR result\n    if (xor_sum == 0) {\n        return \"Second\";\n    } else {\n        return \"First\";\n    }\n}\n\n\n    Your task is to create a hard negative document.\n    - The hard negative document should contain a coding problem using the similar context as the user query but test a different algorithm.\n    - The hard negative document should also contain the python solution code.\n    - The hard negative document should not be related to algorithm: Game Theory.\n    Directly response the content of hard negative document.\n    "}], "max_tokens": 2000}}

Implement a function that takes in the list of book publish years, the start year, and the end year, and returns the count of books published in that range.\n\nYou must ensure your solution is efficient, particularly for large sets of book records, where a naive linear scan could be too slow.\n\n**Input**:\n- A sorted array of integers `books[]` representing the publish years (1 <= books.length <= 10^5, 1 <= books[i] <= 10^9).\n- An integer `startYear` (1 <= startYear <= 10^9).\n- An integer `endYear` (1 <= endYear <= 10^9, endYear >= startYear).\n\n**Output**:\n- An integer representing the total number of books published between `startYear` and `endYear`.\n\n**Function Signature**:\n```cpp\nint countBooksInYearRange(const std::vector<int>& books, int startYear, int endYear);\n```\n\n    **positive document**\n    You are given a list of integers representing the weight capacities of various containers. You need to determine the maximum weight that can be evenly distributed among a specified number of containers without exceeding their capacities. The goal is to compute the largest integer weight `X` such that all containers, when filled with `X` units, will not overflow. Write a function `max_even_distribution(containers: List[int], num_containers: int) -> int` that takes a list of integers `containers` and an integer `num_containers` and returns the maximum weight `X` that can be evenly distributed.\n\n**Constraints**:\n- The length of `containers` (denoted as `N`) will be between 1 and 10^5.\n- Each weight capacity in `containers` will be an integer between 1 and 10^9.\n- You must ensure your solution is efficient, ideally O(N log(max_weight)) where `max_weight` is the largest weight in the containers.\n\n**Example**:\n```\nInput: containers = [10, 15, 20, 25], num_containers = 4\nOutput: 10\n\nInput: containers = [5, 7, 12, 3], num_containers = 3\nOutput: 3\n```\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef max_even_distribution(containers: List[int], num_containers: int) -> int:\n    def can_distribute(weight):\n        count = 0\n        for capacity in containers:\n            count += capacity // weight\n            if count >= num_containers:\n                return True\n        return count >= num_containers\n\n    low, high = 1, max(containers)\n    best_weight = 0\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if can_distribute(mid):\n            best_weight = mid  # mid is a valid distribution weight\n            low = mid + 1  # look for a bigger weight\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1  # look for a smaller weight\n\n    return best_weight\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(max_even_distribution([10, 15, 20, 25], 4)) # Output: 10\n# print(max_even_distribution([5, 7, 12, 3], 3))    # Output: 3\n\n\n    Your task is to create a hard negative document.\n    - The hard negative document should contain a coding problem using the similar context as the user query but test a different algorithm.\n    - The hard negative document should also contain the python solution code.\n    - The hard negative document should not be related to algorithm: Binary Search.\n    Directly response the content of hard negative document.\n    "}], "max_tokens": 2000}}

Your goal is to find the shortest travel time from your starting town to all other towns in the region. However, there is a catch: you can encounter situations where some roads could be temporarily \"faster\" due to real-time updates (such as an accident clearing up or a new road opening), and the travel times can be negative due to discounts or incentives. \n\nYou are tasked with writing a function `find_shortest_travel_times(num_towns, roads, start_town)` that takes in:\n- `num_towns`: an integer representing the number of towns (numbered from 0 to num_towns-1),\n- `roads`: a list of tuples, where each tuple (u, v, t) indicates there is a road from town u to town v that takes t time (which can be negative),\n- `start_town`: an integer representing the starting town's index.\n\nThe function should return a list of the shortest travel times to each town from the starting town. If a town is unreachable, represent its travel time as \"inf\".\n\n    **positive document**\n    You are tasked with optimizing a freight delivery system for a city. The city is modeled as a directed graph where intersections are nodes and the roads between them are edges with weights representing the shipping time (in hours). Your goal is to determine the shortest shipping time from a specific warehouse to several destination points, taking into account the possibility of re-routing paths if it leads to a shorter total time.\n\nHowever, the delivery routes can be impacted by road closures or delays, which are represented by negative weights that occur on certain edges after a specific number of traversals. You need to find the shortest shipping time from the warehouse to all destination points, considering the potential adjustment of routes due to these delays.\n\nYou will receive the following input:\n- An integer `n`, the number of intersections (nodes) in the city.\n- A list of edges represented as an array of arrays, where each inner array has three integers `[u, v, w]`, indicating a directed edge from intersection `u` to intersection `v` with shipping time `w`. Some edges may have negative `w`, representing delays.\n- An integer `k`, representing the maximum number of deliveries you can make before needing to make adjustments to your route.\n\nYour task is to implement a method `findShortestShippingTimes(n, edges, k)` that returns an array of the shortest shipping times from the warehouse (intersection 0) to each intersection indexed from 0 to n-1. If an intersection is unreachable, return `-1` for that intersection. \n\nConstraints:\n- The number of intersections `n` is between `1` and `10^3`.\n- The number of edges `m` can go up to `10^4`.\n- You can assume that the edges are given in a way that ensures the graph is potentially connected, but may contain cycles and negative weights.\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class FreightDelivery {\n\n    public static int[] findShortestShippingTimes(int n, int[][] edges, int k) {\n        int[] shippingTimes = new int[n];\n        Arrays.fill(shippingTimes, Integer.MAX_VALUE);\n        shippingTimes[0] = 0; // Starting point is the warehouse\n        \n        // To handle negative weights we use a modified Bellman-Ford approach\n        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {\n            int[] tempTimes = Arrays.copyOf(shippingTimes, n);\n            for (int[] edge : edges) {\n                int u = edge[0];\n                int v = edge[1];\n                int w = edge[2];\n                \n                if (shippingTimes[u] != Integer.MAX_VALUE && (tempTimes[v] > shippingTimes[u] + w)) {\n                    tempTimes[v] = shippingTimes[u] + w;\n                }\n            }\n            shippingTimes = tempTimes;\n        }\n        \n        // Replace reachable times with -1 for unreachable nodes\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            if (shippingTimes[i] == Integer.MAX_VALUE) {\n                shippingTimes[i] = -1;\n            }\n        }\n        \n        return shippingTimes;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int n = 5;\n        int[][] edges = {{0, 1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, -2}, {3, 1, 1}, {0, 4, 9}};\n        int k = 3;\n        int[] result = findShortestShippingTimes(n, edges, k);\n        \n        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result)); // Output the shortest shipping times\n    }\n}\n\n\n    Your task is to create a hard negative document.\n    - The hard negative document should contain a coding problem using the similar context as the user query but test a different algorithm.\n    - The hard negative document should also contain the python solution code.\n    - The hard negative document should not be related to algorithm: Bellman-Ford Algorithm.\n    Directly response the content of hard negative document.\n    "}], "max_tokens": 2000}}

If the product is already in the cart, it should be marked as the most recently used. If the cart is full (contains `n` products), the least recently used product should be removed before adding a new one.\n\n2. **get_cart()**: Returns the list of product_ids currently in the cart in the order from the least recently used to the most recently used.\n\nYou need to implement the `ShoppingCart` class which supports these operations efficiently.\n\nConstraints:\n- The maximum shelf space `n` is at least 1 and at most 1000.\n- Product IDs are positive integers.\n\nWrite the class `ShoppingCart` with the operations described above.\n\n    **positive document**\n    Imagine you are developing a smart refrigerator that can keep track of food items and their freshness. The refrigerator has a limited capacity for storing food items. Each time you open the fridge and look for an item, the fridge needs to remind you of the items based on how recently you accessed them, with the least recently accessed items being the first to be suggested for removal if the fridge reaches capacity.\n\nYou need to implement a data structure that simulates this behavior. The refrigerator can:\n\n1. Add a new food item with a corresponding expiration date.\n2. Get the most recently accessed food item when you open the fridge.\n3. Automatically remove the least recently used food item when the maximum capacity is reached.\n\nThe food items are identified by a unique string (item name). If you try to access an item that doesn't exist, return `null`.\n\nYou are required to implement a class `SmartFridge` with the following methods:\n\n- `SmartFridge(int capacity)`: Initializes the smart fridge with a specified `capacity`.\n- `void addItem(String item, String expirationDate)`: Adds a new food item. If the item already exists, just update its expiration date and mark it as recently accessed. If the fridge exceeds capacity, remove the least recently accessed item.\n- `String getRecentlyAccessed()`: Returns the name of the most recently accessed food item. If no items exist, return `null`.\n- `String getExpirationDate(String item)`: Returns the expiration date of the specified item. If the item does not exist, return `null`.\n\nYou can assume that the input strings (`item` and `expirationDate`) are always valid.\nimport java.util.LinkedHashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\npublic class SmartFridge {\n    private final int capacity;\n    private final LinkedHashMap<String, String> fridge; // Stores item and their expiration date\n    \n    public SmartFridge(int capacity) {\n        this.capacity = capacity;\n        this.fridge = new LinkedHashMap<String, String>(capacity, 0.75f, true) {\n            protected boolean removeEldestEntry(Map.Entry<String, String> eldest) {\n                return size() > capacity; // Remove the eldest entry if size exceeds capacity\n            }\n        };\n    }\n    \n    public void addItem(String item, String expirationDate) {\n        fridge.put(item, expirationDate); // Automatically handles LRU eviction\n    }\n    \n    public String getRecentlyAccessed() {\n        if (fridge.isEmpty()) {\n            return null; // No items in the fridge\n        }\n        // Getting the last accessed item\n        String lastItem = null;\n        for (String key : fridge.keySet()) {\n            lastItem = key; // Will end with the most recently accessed item due to access order\n        }\n        return lastItem; // Return the name of the most recently accessed food item\n    }\n\n    public String getExpirationDate(String item) {\n        return fridge.get(item); // Return the expiration date or null if not found\n    }\n}\n\n\n    Your task is to create a hard negative document.\n    - The hard negative document should contain a coding problem using the similar context as the user query but test a different algorithm.\n    - The hard negative document should also contain the python solution code.\n    - The hard negative document should not be related to algorithm: LRU Cache Algorithm.\n    Directly response the content of hard negative document.\n    "}], "max_tokens": 2000}}

You may not reuse integers in a group, but you should ensure that each group is only included once in the output regardless of the order of integers.\n\nFor example, given the list `[10, 1, 2, 7, 6, 1, 5]` and the target `8`, the function should return `[[1, 1, 6], [1, 2, 5], [2, 6]]`.\n\n**Note**: Your solution must handle duplicates in the input list gracefully, ensuring no duplicate combinations are included in the result.\n\n    **positive document**\n    You are given a list of integers called `nums` and an integer `target`. Your task is to find all unique sets of integers from `nums` that can sum up to `target`. Each number in `nums` may be used multiple times in the combination, and you should return all possible unique combinations of integers that add up to `target`. The order of combinations does not matter, but the inner lists must be sorted in ascending order. \n\nYou need to ensure that there are no duplicate combinations in the output.

Your task is to implement a function `allocateIngredients` that takes two matrices\u2014`M1` and `M2`\u2014representing the ingredient requirements of different cake types, and efficiently computes the total quantities needed using matrix multiplication.\n\nThe matrices will be provided in two-dimensional arrays, and your function should return a 2D array that represents the multiplied matrix, rounded to whole numbers. Due to the potential large dimensions of the matrices (up to 128 x 128), you are required to use an efficient algorithm to perform this calculation.\n\nFunction signature:\n```cpp\nvector<vector<int>> allocateIngredients(const vector<vector<int>>& M1, const vector<vector<int>>& M2);\n```\n\n**Example**:\nInput:\n```\nM1 = [[1,2],[3,4]]\nM2 = [[5,6],[7,8]]\n```\nOutput:\n```\n[[19, 22], [43, 50]]\n```\nThe output indicates that the allocation of ingredients results in 19 units for cake type 1 and 22 units for cake type 2, considering the ingredient requirements from both matrices.\n\n**Constraints**:\n- The matrices will always be square and of size n x n (1 <= n <= 128).\n- All values in M1 and M2 are integers in the range of 0 to 100.\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <cmath>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nvector<vector<int>> add(const vector<vector<int>>& A, const vector<vector<int>>& B) {\n    int n = A.size();\n    vector<vector<int>> C(n, vector<int>(n));\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)\n            C[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j];\n    return C;\n}\n\nvector<vector<int>> subtract(const vector<vector<int>>& A, const vector<vector<int>>& B) {\n    int n = A.size();\n    vector<vector<int>> C(n, vector<int>(n));\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)\n            C[i][j] = A[i][j] - B[i][j];\n    return C;\n}\n\nvector<vector<int>> strassen(const vector<vector<int>>& A, const vector<vector<int>>& B) {\n    int n = A.size();\n    if (n == 1) {\n        return {{A[0][0] * B[0][0]}};\n    }\n\n    int k = n / 2;\n    \n    vector<vector<int>> A11(k, vector<int>(k)), A12(k, vector<int>(k)), \n                        A21(k, vector<int>(k)), A22(k, vector<int>(k)),\n                        B11(k, vector<int>(k)), B12(k, vector<int>(k)), \n                        B21(k, vector<int>(k)), B22(k, vector<int>(k));\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)\n        for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {\n            A11[i][j] = A[i][j];\n            A12[i][j] = A[i][j + k];\n            A21[i][j] = A[i + k][j];\n            A22[i][j] = A[i + k][j + k];\n            B11[i][j] = B[i][j];\n            B12[i][j] = B[i][j + k];\n            B21[i][j] = B[i + k][j];\n            B22[i][j] = B[i + k][j + k];\n        }\n\n    auto M1 = strassen(add(A11, A22), add(B11, B22));\n    auto M2 = strassen(add(A21, A22), B11);\n    auto M3 = strassen(A11, subtract(B12, B22));\n    auto M4 = strassen(A22, subtract(B21, B11));\n    auto M5 = strassen(add(A11, A12), B22);\n    auto M6 = strassen(subtract(A21, A11), add(B11, B12));\n    auto M7 = strassen(subtract(A12, A22), add(B21, B22));\n\n    vector<vector<int>> C(n, vector<int>(n));\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {\n            C[i][j] = M1[i][j] + M4[i][j] - M5[i][j] + M7[i][j];\n            C[i][j+k] = M3[i][j] + M5[i][j];\n            C[i+k][j] = M2[i][j] + M4[i][j];\n            C[i+k][j+k] = M1[i][j] + M3[i][j] - M2[i][j] + M6[i][j];\n        }\n    }\n    return C;\n}\n\nvector<vector<int>> allocateIngredients(const vector<vector<int>>& M1, const vector<vector<int>>& M2) {\n    vector<vector<int>> result = strassen(M1, M2);\n    for (auto& row : result)\n        for (auto& val : row)\n            val = round(val); // Ensuring the amounts are whole numbers\n    return result;\n}\n\n\n    Your task is to create a hard negative document.\n    - The hard negative document should contain a coding problem using the similar context as the user query but test a different algorithm.\n    - The hard negative document should also contain the python solution code.\n    - The hard negative document should not be related to algorithm: Strassen's Algorithm.\n    Directly response the content of hard negative document.\n    "}], "max_tokens": 2000}}

Each donation amount can be used an unlimited number of times. \n\nWrite a function `count_ways(N: int, donations: List[int], target: int) -> int` that takes the number of unique donation amounts `N`, a list of integers `donations` representing the donation amounts, and an integer `target` representing the target donation amount. Your function should return the number of distinct combinations of donations that sum up to exactly `target`. \n\nFor example:\n- If `donations = [1, 2, 5]` and `target = 5`, the function should return `4`, as there are four ways to combine these donations to reach 5: (1+1+1+1+1), (1+1+1+2), (1+2+2), (5).\n- If `donations = [2, 3, 7]` and `target = 0`, the function should return `1`, because there is one way to reach 0 amount (by not using any donations).\n\nYou may assume that the input values will always be non-negative.\n\n    **positive document**\n    You are organizing a charity event and have several denominations of tickets available for sale.

Your task is to implement a function `minimum_multiplication_cost(dimensions: List[int]) -> int` that receives an array of dimensions and returns the minimum cost.\n\n**Function Signature**: \n```python\ndef minimum_multiplication_cost(dimensions: List[int]) -> int:\n```\n**Input**:  \n- A list `dimensions` with at least 2 and at most 100 elements. Each element is an integer between 1 and 100.\n\n**Output**: \n- An integer representing the minimum cost to multiply the matrices.\n\n**Example**:  \n```python\nassert minimum_multiplication_cost([10, 20, 30]) == 6000\nassert minimum_multiplication_cost([10, 20, 30, 40]) == 30000\nassert minimum_multiplication_cost([10, 30, 20, 40]) == 24000\n```\ndef minimum_multiplication_cost(dimensions):\n    n = len(dimensions) - 1  # Because dimensions represents an array of size n+1\n    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    for l in range(2, n + 1):  # l is the chain length\n        for i in range(n - l + 1):\n            j = i + l - 1\n            dp[i][j] = float('inf')\n            for k in range(i, j):\n                cost = dp[i][k] + dp[k + 1][j] + dimensions[i] * dimensions[k + 1] * dimensions[j + 1]\n                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], cost)\n    \n    return dp[0][n - 1]\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(minimum_multiplication_cost([10, 20, 30]))  # Output: 6000\nprint(minimum_multiplication_cost([10, 20, 30, 40]))  # Output: 30000\nprint(minimum_multiplication_cost([10, 30, 20, 40]))  # Output: 24000\n\n\n    Your task is to create a hard negative document.\n    - The hard negative document should contain a coding problem using the similar context as the user query but test a different algorithm.\n    - The hard negative document should also contain the python solution code.\n    - The hard negative document should not be related to algorithm: Matrix Chain Multiplication.\n    Directly response the content of hard negative document.\n    "}], "max_tokens": 2000}}

Your goal is to return the arrangement of cupcakes in the order of their baking times.\n\nGiven a list of integers representing the baking times of the cupcakes, implement a function that rearranges the list as described and returns the sorted list.\n\nFunction Signature:\n```python\ndef arrange_cupcakes(baking_times: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    pass\n```\n\n**Input**:\n- baking_times: A list of integers where 1 \u2264 len(baking_times) \u2264 1000 and 1 \u2264 baking_times[i] \u2264 1000, representing the baking times of each type of cupcake.\n\n**Output**:\n- A list of integers representing the cupcake baking times sorted in ascending order.\n\n**Example**:\n```python\narrange_cupcakes([5, 3, 8, 6, 2])\n```\nOutput:\n```\n[2, 3, 5, 6, 8]\n```\n\n    **positive document**\n    You are given a list of integers representing scores achieved by athletes in various competitions.

You should keep track of the number of write operations (swaps) performed during the sorting process.\n\nWrite a Python function `sort_scores_and_count_writes(scores: List[int]) -> Tuple[List[int], int]` where:\n- `scores` is a list of integers representing the scores.\n- The function returns a tuple containing the sorted list of scores and the total number of write operations.\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef sort_scores_and_count_writes(scores: List[int]) -> Tuple[List[int], int]:\n    n = len(scores)\n    write_operations = 0\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Assume the minimum is the first element of the unsorted segment\n        min_index = i\n        # Find the minimum element in the unsorted section\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            if scores[j] < scores[min_index]:\n                min_index = j\n\n        # If the minimum is not the position of i, swap them\n        if min_index != i:\n            scores[i], scores[min_index] = scores[min_index], scores[i]\n            write_operations += 1  # Count the swap as one write operation\n\n    return scores, write_operations\n\n# Example usage:\n# scores = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]\n# sorted_scores, writes = sort_scores_and_count_writes(scores)\n# print(sorted_scores)  # Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]\n# print(writes)  # Output: Total number of write operations\n\n\n    Your task is to create a hard negative document.\n    - The hard negative document should contain a coding problem using the similar context as the user query but test a different algorithm.\n    - The hard negative document should also contain the python solution code.\n    - The hard negative document should not be related to algorithm: Selection Sort.\n    Directly response the content of hard negative document.\n    "}], "max_tokens": 2000}}

Your goal is to write a method that locates all starting indices of the phrase in each document, returning a list of lists where each inner list corresponds to the indices found in each document.\n\nYour implementation should be efficient enough to handle large documents and multiple phrases. Assume that the phrase contains only lowercase letters and spaces, and that there are no overlapping occurrences.\n\n**Function Signature**:\n```java\npublic List<List<Integer>> findPhraseOccurrences(String[] documents, String phrase);\n```\n\n**Input**:\n- documents: An array of strings (1 \u2264 documents.length \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 documents[i].length \u2264 10^5)\n- phrase: A string (1 \u2264 phrase.length \u2264 100)\n\n**Output**:\n- Return a list of lists of integers, where each list contains the starting indices of the occurrences of the phrase in the corresponding document. If a document does not contain the phrase, it should have an empty list.\n\n**Example**:\n```java\nString[] documents = {\n    \"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\",\n    \"the quick brown fox\",\n    \"lazy dogs are not the same as quick brown foxes\"\n};\nString phrase = \"quick brown fox\";\n\nList<List<Integer>> result = findPhraseOccurrences(documents, phrase);\n```\nOutput:\n```\n[\n    [16],\n    [0],\n    [37]\n]\n```\n\n    **positive document**\n    You are given two strings, `text` and `pattern`, where `text` can contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation. Your task is to find all starting indices in the `text` where the `pattern` appears as a substring, and return the indices in a vector. The function should also ensure that the search is efficient, particularly in cases where the `text` is very large (up to 100,000 characters long).\n\nThe implementation should handle cases of overlapping patterns and return unique starting positions only. For instance, if the `pattern` is found multiple times starting from the same index, it should only be counted once.\n\nWrite a function:\n\n```cpp\nvector<int> find_pattern_indices(const string &text, const string &pattern);\n```\n\n**Input**:\n- `text` (1 \u2264 length of text \u2264 100,000)\n- `pattern` (1 \u2264 length of pattern \u2264 100)\n\n**Output**:\n- A vector of integers containing unique starting indices of substrings in `text` which match `pattern`.\n\n**Example**:\n```cpp\nInput:\ntext = \"ababcabcabababd\"\npattern = \"abab\"\nOutput:\n[2, 7]\n```\n\nIn this case, \"abab\" appears starting at indices 2 and 7 in the `text`.\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <vector>\n#include <unordered_set>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nvector<int> find_pattern_indices(const string &text, const string &pattern) {\n    vector<int> result;\n    int n = text.size();\n    int m = pattern.size();\n    \n    if (m > n) {\n        return result; // No occurrence possible if pattern is longer than text\n    }\n\n    // Create a hash of the pattern and the initial text segment\n    unsigned long long pattern_hash = 0, text_hash = 0;\n    const int base = 256; // Number of possible characters (extended ASCII)\n    const int prime = 101; // A prime number for modulus\n    unsigned long long power = 1;\n\n    // Precompute power(base, m-1) % prime\n    for (int i = 0; i < m - 1; i++) {\n        power = (power * base) % prime;\n    }\n\n    // Calculate hash for the pattern and the first segment of the text\n    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n        pattern_hash = (base * pattern_hash + pattern[i]) % prime;\n        text_hash = (base * text_hash + text[i]) % prime;\n    }\n\n    // Slide over the text to find matching hashes\n    for (int i = 0; i <= n - m; i++) {\n        // Check the hash values\n        if (pattern_hash == text_hash) {\n            // Check actual substring to avoid hash collision\n            if (text.substr(i, m) == pattern) {\n                result.push_back(i);\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Calculate hash for the next segment (if there is one)\n        if (i < n - m) {\n            text_hash = (base * (text_hash - text[i] * power) + text[i + m]) % prime;\n            text_hash = (text_hash + prime) % prime; // Ensure non-negative\n        }\n    }\n\n    return result;\n}\n\n// Example Usage\nint main() {\n    string text = \"ababcabcabababd\";\n    string pattern = \"abab\";\n    vector<int> indices = find_pattern_indices(text, pattern);\n    \n    cout << \"[\";\n    for (int i = 0; i < indices.size(); ++i) {\n        cout << indices[i];\n        if (i < indices.size() - 1) cout << \", \";\n    }\n    cout << \"]\" << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\n    Your task is to create a hard negative document.\n    - The hard negative document should contain a coding problem using the similar context as the user query but test a different algorithm.\n    - The hard negative document should also contain the python solution code.\n    - The hard negative document should not be related to algorithm: Rabin-Karp Algorithm.\n    Directly response the content of hard negative document.\n    "}], "max_tokens": 2000}}

Each band has a unique popularity score. However, there is a twist: we want to ensure that the bands play in such a way that for any segment of the festival, the total popularity of the bands must remain balanced. This means, for any selected segment of bands that you pick, it should contain bands with popularity scores that allow for a median score at each division point.\n\nTo redistribute the bands' sequence into an optimal line-up, you need to implement a function that sorts the bands based on their popularity scores using a divide-and-conquer method where each selected pivot effectively ensures that the bands with lower scores are always before the bands with higher scores as you partition them. \n\n### Input:\n- The first line will contain an integer \\( n \\) (1 \u2264 \\( n \\) \u2264 100,000), representing the number of bands.\n- The second line will contain \\( n \\) space-separated integers \\( p_1, p_2, ..., p_n \\) (1 \u2264 \\( p_i \\) \u2264 1,000,000), representing the popularity scores of the bands.\n\n### Output:\n- Print a single line containing the popularity scores sorted in ascending order.\n\n### Example:\n#### Input:\n```\n5\n3 6 8 10 1\n```\n\n#### Output:\n```\n1 3 6 8 10\n```\n\n### Constraints:\n- You must implement the sorting without using built-in sort functions or algorithms.\n\n---\n\n    **positive document**\n    You are given an array of integers.
