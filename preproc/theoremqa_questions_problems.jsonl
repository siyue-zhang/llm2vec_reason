Your task is:\n**Problem**\nImagine you're developing a photo editing app that includes a feature to automatically enhance images. The app processes images that are 32 pixels wide and 32 pixels tall, and it only works with grayscale images. The enhancement feature starts by applying a special filter to the image. This filter is a small square that scans over the original image, covering 5 pixels by 5 pixels at a time. It moves across and down the image in steps of 2 pixels and uses a technique to ensure that it can scan right to the edges of the image by adding a single layer of invisible pixels around the original image. After this filter is applied, it produces a new set of smaller images, each representing a different aspect of the original image's details. What is the size of one of these new images?\n"}], "max_tokens": 5000}}

The probability of an eruption on any given day is 0.6, and the probability of a normal day is 0.4. The condition on day $k$ depends on the condition of day $k-1$, with the probability of the condition remaining the same (eruption to eruption or normal to normal) being 0.55. A research station nearby monitors these signals and has a system that reacts to these environmental changes. The system has a 60% chance of activating (sending an alert signal) on an eruption day and a 40% chance of activating on a normal day, i.e., P(alert $\text{ signal }$ $\text{ given }$ eruption) = 0.6 and P(alert $\text{ signal }$ $\text{ given }$ normal) = 0.4. Over three consecutive days, the system (1) sent an alert signal, (2) did not send an alert signal, and (3) sent an alert signal again.

You have a set of original high-quality videos (source) and a method to compress these videos to send over the network. The compression method involves converting the original videos into a format that requires less data to transmit. However, when the video is decompressed on the viewer's end, there's some loss in video quality (distortion). You're considering adding a new compression technique that introduces a new format for the videos. This new format is designed to reduce the amount of data needed even further while attempting to maintain video quality. Will adding this new compression format potentially reduce the overall loss in video quality for the same amount of data transmitted? True or False?\n"}], "max_tokens": 5000}}

Your task is:\n**Problem**\nImagine you're playing a guessing game with a deck of cards numbered from 1 to 256. You're trying to guess a specific card that your friend has picked at random from the deck. Your strategy is to divide the deck into two equal parts and ask whether the card is in the first half or the second half. Based on the answer, you then divide the remaining half into another two equal parts and repeat the question. How many questions do you need to ask to identify the exact card?\n"}], "max_tokens": 5000}}
